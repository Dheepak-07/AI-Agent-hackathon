I placed my order at 11:48 pm  the rider was assigned who later told that he was not aware of such order as he didn't get notified on his phone  another rider assigned  who told me that he is having 7 other orders to deliver nearby and he will take another 30-40 min to deliver my order.....it's been 1 am in the morning and I am still waiting for my order.
